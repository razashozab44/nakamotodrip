### **Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0: The Evolution of the Internet**

The internet has undergone a dramatic transformation over the decades, evolving through distinct phases that define how we interact with technology and information. Here's a detailed look at Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0:

#### **Web 1.0: The Static Web (1990s - Early 2000s)**



- **Characteristics**:  
  Web 1.0 was the first phase of the internet. It was largely static, focusing on delivering information. Websites were simple, read-only pages designed for one-way communication.
  
- **Technology Used**:  
  HTML for static pages, HTTP for communication, and limited interactivity.  
  Examples: Early websites like Yahoo!, personal blogs, and directories.  

- **Limitations**:  
  - Lack of interactivity.  
  - Limited user engagement.  
  - Users were primarily consumers of content.

#### **Web 2.0: The Social Web (2004 - Present)**



- **Characteristics**:  
  This phase brought dynamic and user-generated content, fostering interactivity and collaboration. Web 2.0 introduced platforms where users could create, share, and interact with content.

- **Technology Used**:  
  HTML5, JavaScript, CSS, AJAX, and APIs to enable dynamic interactions.  
  Examples: Social media (Facebook, Twitter), streaming platforms (YouTube, Spotify), and e-commerce websites (Amazon, eBay).

- **Key Features**:  
  - User-generated content.  
  - Interactive interfaces.  
  - Platforms and ecosystems like mobile apps and APIs.  

- **Drawbacks**:  
  - Centralized control by tech giants.  
  - Privacy concerns and data exploitation.  
  - Monetization of user data.

#### **Web 3.0: The Decentralized Web (Emerging)**



- **Characteristics**:  
  Web 3.0 represents a shift toward decentralization and user ownership. It aims to eliminate intermediaries, giving control back to individuals through blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies.

- **Technology Used**:  
  Blockchain, smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and AI.  
  Examples: Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, NFTs, and DAOs.

- **Key Features**:  
  - Decentralized infrastructure using blockchain.  
  - Interoperability across platforms.  
  - Privacy and data ownership for users.  
  - Integration of AI for smarter interactions.  

- **Potential Impact**:  
  Web 3.0 promises to reshape the digital landscape by addressing Web 2.0’s flaws, fostering innovation, and creating new economic models.
